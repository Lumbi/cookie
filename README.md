This is a very modest 2D game framework built on top of SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/).
Inspired from SpriteKit and XNA, I'm building this mainly for it's own sake.

Done:

- Game update/render loop
- Scene graph
- Textures
- Animations
- Basic physics
- AABB collisions
- Input - Keyboard

Todo:

- Audio
- Signal/Slots
- Input - Game controllers
- Circle-to-Rect / Circle-to-Circle collisions
- Collision callbacks
- Scene transition support
- Tile-based scene support
- I/O & Persistency
- Android/iOS support
- Optimizations
- and much more...
